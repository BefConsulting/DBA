# PostgreSQL Best-Practice Configuration

A checklist of what to tune in the **PostgreSQL server** for a production-grade deployment. Defaults ship conservative — these are the knobs that matter most. Each entry says **what it does** and **where you set it**.

**For Linux host-level tuning** (sysctl, memory/overcommit, swappiness, dirty-page writeback, THP/huge pages, storage, CPU, limits) see the dedicated guide: **[linux.md](linux.md)**.

**See also:** [linux.md](linux.md) (host/kernel tuning) · [wal-and-checkpoints.md](wal-and-checkpoints.md) (checkpoint sizing) · [deep-dive.md](deep-dive.md) §2 (memory/planner), §4 (security) · [performance-analysis.md](performance-analysis.md) · [../scripts/settings.sql](../scripts/settings.sql) (audit current values)

> **Golden rule:** change one thing, measure, repeat. Use `databases/scripts/settings.sql` to see current values, their `source`, and whether they need a restart.

## Part 1 — Linux host level

Moved to its own guide → **[linux.md](linux.md)**. It defines each kernel/host setting one at a time (memory & overcommit, `overcommit_ratio`, `swappiness`, dirty-page writeback, THP & huge pages, storage/filesystem, CPU/NUMA, limits & network) with **recommended values** and **how to set them** (live + persistent).

---

## Part 2 — PostgreSQL server

**Where these live:** in `postgresql.conf`, or set them at runtime with `ALTER SYSTEM SET ... ;` (which writes to `postgresql.auto.conf`). After changing, either `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` (for "reloadable" params) or restart (for ones marked `postmaster`). Check any value and how to apply it with the query in the last section.

### Memory
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `shared_buffers` | ~25% of RAM | PostgreSQL's **own** cache of table/index pages. The single most important memory setting. Don't exceed ~40% — the OS page cache also caches data, and double-buffering wastes RAM. (Requires restart.) |
| `effective_cache_size` | 50–75% of RAM | **Not an allocation** — it's a *hint* to the planner about how much data is likely cached (in `shared_buffers` + OS cache). Higher values make the planner favor **index scans** over sequential scans, because it assumes pages will be found in memory. |
| `work_mem` | 16–64MB | Memory for **one** sort or hash operation. It's **per node, per connection** — a complex query with many sorts × many connections can multiply this fast, so size it against peak concurrency, not just available RAM. Too low → sorts spill to disk (`external merge`). |
| `maintenance_work_mem` | 512MB–2GB | Memory for maintenance ops (VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, restores). Larger = faster index builds and vacuums. Only a few run at once, so it can be much bigger than `work_mem`. |
| `autovacuum_work_mem` | inherit or set | Like `maintenance_work_mem` but caps memory **per autovacuum worker**, so many workers don't collectively exhaust RAM. |
| `huge_pages` | `try` (or `on` once host configured) | Tells PG to back `shared_buffers` with the host's huge pages, reducing page-table overhead. `try` = use if available, else fall back. |

### WAL & checkpoints  ([details](wal-and-checkpoints.md))
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `wal_level` | `replica` (or `logical` for logical repl/CDC) | How much info is written to WAL. `replica` supports streaming replicas + PITR; `logical` additionally enables logical decoding. |
| `max_wal_size` | large enough that checkpoints are time-triggered | Soft cap on WAL between checkpoints. If WAL fills this before the timeout, a checkpoint is **forced** (`checkpoints_req` rises) — raise it until forced checkpoints ≈ 0. |
| `min_wal_size` | `1`–`2GB` | Floor of WAL files PG keeps and recycles instead of deleting, avoiding churn during bursts. |
| `checkpoint_timeout` | `15min` (`30min` write-heavy) | Max time between automatic checkpoints. Longer = fewer checkpoints and fewer full-page image writes, but longer crash recovery. |
| `checkpoint_completion_target` | `0.9` | Spreads a checkpoint's writes across 90% of the interval instead of dumping them at once — smooths the I/O spike. |
| `wal_compression` | `on` | Compresses full-page images in WAL — less WAL volume for a little CPU. |
| `wal_buffers` | `16MB` (or `-1` = auto) | Shared memory buffering WAL before it's flushed to disk. |

### Durability (don't disable in production)
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `fsync` | `on` | Forces WAL/data to physically reach disk. **Never turn off in production** — off means a crash can leave a corrupted, unrecoverable database. |
| `full_page_writes` | `on` | Writes a full image of a page the first time it changes after a checkpoint, protecting against **torn pages** (partial writes on crash). |
| `synchronous_commit` | `on` | Whether `COMMIT` waits for WAL to be durably flushed. `on` = no data loss on crash. Can be relaxed to `off`/`local` (or per-transaction) on hot paths if you accept losing the last fraction of a second of commits. |

### Autovacuum (keep it aggressive at scale)
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `autovacuum` | `on` | Background process that reclaims dead tuples (bloat) and refreshes planner stats. Never disable globally. |
| `autovacuum_max_workers` | `3`–`6` | How many tables can be vacuumed concurrently. Raise it when you have many tables. |
| `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` | `0.05` (lower for big tables) | Vacuum triggers at `threshold + scale_factor × rows`. Default `0.2` (20%) means a 1B-row table waits for 200M dead rows — far too long. Override per-table for large tables. |
| `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` | `0.02`–`0.05` | Same idea for ANALYZE — keeps planner statistics fresh so row estimates stay accurate. |
| `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` | raise (e.g. `2000`) | Autovacuum throttles itself with a cost budget; the gentle default lets it fall behind on busy systems. Raise to let it keep up. |
| `autovacuum_naptime` | `15s`–`30s` | How often the launcher checks whether tables need work. |
| Freeze params (`autovacuum_freeze_max_age`, …) | tune for high-XID workloads | Govern transaction-ID **freezing** to prevent wraparound. See [deep-dive.md](deep-dive.md) §1.3. |

### Planner
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `random_page_cost` | `1.1` on SSD/NVMe | The planner's estimated cost of a **random** page read relative to a sequential one. The default `4.0` assumes spinning disks and discourages index use; on SSD random reads are nearly as cheap as sequential, so lower it to favor index scans. |
| `effective_io_concurrency` | `200` for SSD/NVMe | How many concurrent I/O requests the storage can handle; enables prefetching for bitmap heap scans. |
| `default_statistics_target` | `100` (raise to `500`+ for skewed columns) | How many histogram buckets / distinct values ANALYZE collects per column. More detail = better selectivity estimates, at the cost of slightly slower ANALYZE and bigger stats. |
| `jit` | `off` for OLTP, `on` for analytics | Just-in-time compilation of expressions. Helps long analytical queries; its compile overhead hurts short OLTP queries. |

### Connections (cap them; pool instead)
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `max_connections` | `100`–`200` + **PgBouncer** | Hard cap on backends. Each connection is a process with RAM overhead; raising this is worse than putting a connection pooler (PgBouncer) in front. (Requires restart.) |
| `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` | `5min` | Auto-terminates sessions stuck "idle in transaction" — those pin the xmin horizon (blocking vacuum) and may hold locks. |
| `statement_timeout` | `30s`–`60s` (per app) | Aborts any single query running longer than this — a safety net against runaway queries. |
| `lock_timeout` | `5s` | Gives up waiting for a lock after this long, so a blocked statement fails fast instead of stalling indefinitely. |
| `tcp_keepalives_idle` / `_interval` | set | Lets PG detect and clean up dead client connections. |

### Logging & observability (turn these on early)
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `logging_collector` | `on` | Captures stderr into managed log files. |
| `log_min_duration_statement` | `1000` (1s) | Logs any statement slower than this — your slow-query feed. |
| `log_checkpoints` | `on` | Logs each checkpoint's timing and buffers written — shows if checkpoints are too frequent. |
| `log_lock_waits` | `on` | Logs when a session waits past `deadlock_timeout` for a lock — surfaces contention. |
| `log_temp_files` | `0` | Logs every temp file written (i.e. `work_mem` spills to disk). |
| `log_autovacuum_min_duration` | `0` or `250ms` | Logs autovacuum runs so you can see if it keeps up. |
| `log_line_prefix` | `'%m [%p] %q%u@%d '` | Prefix on each log line: timestamp, pid, user, database — essential context. |
| `track_io_timing` | `on` | Records real time spent on I/O, shown in `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` and `pg_stat_statements`. |
| `shared_preload_libraries` | `pg_stat_statements` (+ `auto_explain`) | Loads extensions at startup. `pg_stat_statements` aggregates query stats. (Requires restart.) |

### Replication (if applicable) ([details](ha-and-dr.md))
| Parameter | Recommended | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `max_wal_senders` | `10` | Max concurrent WAL-sender processes (one per streaming replica or base backup). |
| `max_replication_slots` | `10` | Max replication slots (one per standby/subscriber) that track how far each consumer has read. |
| `hot_standby` | `on` | Allows read-only queries on a standby while it replays WAL. |
| `max_slot_wal_keep_size` | bound it | Caps how much WAL an inactive slot can pin — prevents a dead replica's slot from filling `pg_wal` and stopping the primary. |
| `archive_mode` + `archive_command` | `on` + pgBackRest/WAL-G | Ships completed WAL segments to archive storage — required for Point-In-Time Recovery. |

### Security essentials ([details](deep-dive.md) §4)
| Setting | Recommended | What it does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `listen_addresses` | only needed interfaces | Which network interfaces PG binds to; don't expose `*` unless intended. |
| `password_encryption` | `scram-sha-256` | Hashing scheme for stored passwords; SCRAM is the modern, secure choice over `md5`. |
| `pg_hba.conf` | `scram-sha-256` + least-privilege host rules | The client authentication rulebook (who, from where, how). Never use `trust` over a network. |
| `ssl` | `on` with valid certs | Encrypts client↔server traffic in transit. |

## Applying & verifying changes

```sql
-- Most params: persists to postgresql.auto.conf
ALTER SYSTEM SET random_page_cost = 1.1;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();           -- for 'sighup' context params

-- Check what needs a restart vs reload, and where a value came from:
SELECT name, setting, unit, source, context, pending_restart
FROM pg_settings
WHERE name IN ('shared_buffers','random_page_cost','max_connections');
```

The `context` column tells you **how a change takes effect**:
- `postmaster` → **requires a full restart** (e.g. `shared_buffers`, `max_connections`, `shared_preload_libraries`).
- `sighup` → a reload is enough (`SELECT pg_reload_conf();` or `pg_ctl reload`).
- `superuser` / `user` → can be set per-session (`SET ...`) or per-role/per-database (`ALTER ROLE/DATABASE ... SET ...`).

The `source` column tells you **where the current value came from** (`default`, `configuration file`, `override`, etc.). Audit everything non-default with the **"Settings changed from default"** query in [../scripts/settings.sql](../scripts/settings.sql).

## Sizing & validation tools
- **PGTune** / **pgconfig** — generate sane starting values from RAM, CPU count, and workload type.
- **pgbench** — load-test before/after a change to confirm it actually helped.
- **`pg_stat_statements`** + [scripts/](../scripts/) — measure the real effect; never tune by guessing.
